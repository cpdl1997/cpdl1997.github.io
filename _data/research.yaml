    abstract-less: Multicollinearity, or near-linear dependencies amongst features, is a statistical phenomenon wherein multiple predictor variables are severely correlated in a multiple regression model. This results in inaccurate parameter estimates, decreased power, low confidence on regressor coefficients and incorrect feature selection in domains such as biological sciences or finance. This paper aims to tackle this issue by constructing a contextual graph based on available domain knowledge. We propose a novel regularization approach called Contextual Graph-guided Fused Lasso (CGFlasso), based on GFLasso regularization to show how prior domain knowledge can improve the current 
    abstract-more: state-of-the-art. We show that our method significantly reduces standard error across multiple datasets.

    abstract-less:  Poultry is one of the largest industries in India, with a market size of USD 23.07 billion in 2022. It is imperative that the health conditions of the poultry chickens are monitored to ensure optimum output. However, due to the size of poultry farms it is a difficult task to keep track of individual chickens and ensure healthy conditions. Our current proposal aims to target this very problem statement using chicken vocalizations. We use various machine learning models to process audio signals of chicken vocalisations and try to find the best implementation combinations to get the best classification results. We find that our method gives 92.23% accuracy and shows
    tag: potential in real-life applications.
