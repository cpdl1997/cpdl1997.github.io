# about me
first-paragraph: I am a junior research fellow at the <a href="https://gtmliitrpr.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Theory and Machine Learning (GTML) Lab</a> affiliated with the <a href="https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/shwetajainiisc/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Shweta Jain</a>, working on federated learning.
# second-paragraph: I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saigon, Vietnam</a>, and was fortunate to spend my most memorable time at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU-HCM_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted</a> (informatics program of 2020) and previously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A7n_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i_Ngh%C4%A9a_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TƒêN Secondary School for the Gifted</a> (mathematics program of 2017) with very good friends - too many to name them here, where we played football (soccer) on concrete fields together afterschool.
research-introduction: I do research in theoretical machine learning generally, having worked on the domains of federated learning in my current role, as well as in counterfactuals during my master thesis.

research-interests:

  - field: Trustworthiness
